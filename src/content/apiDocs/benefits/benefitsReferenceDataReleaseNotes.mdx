### February 4, 2022

We added a new API to the developer portal. This API was previously the EVSS Data Reference Service. It allows consumers to look up the following data for use with benefits claims:

- Contention types
- Countries
- Disabilities
- Intake sites
- Military pay types
- Service branches
- Special circumstances
- States
- VA medical treatment facilities

This API will return only the data that can be used for benefits claims. For example, this API may return only a subset of states or countries that apply to benefits claims.

There are some important differences between this API and the service it replaces:

- The new service requires an API key. Obtain one through <Link to="https://developer.va.gov/onboarding">this onboarding process</Link>.
- There are some stylistic changes to each endpoints’ response format:
  - Contention Types
    - "contentionTypes" array renamed to "items"
  - Countries
    - "countries" array renamed to "items"
  - Disabilities
    - "disability" array renamed to "items"
    - "classificationCode" renamed to "id"
    - "id" is type long
    - "endDate" renamed to "endDateTime"
    - "endDateTime" reported in YYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ format
    - "endDateTime" always included, even if null
  - Intake Sites
    - "intakeSites" array renamed to "items"
    - "code" renamed to "id"
    - "id" is type long
  - Military Pay Types
    - "militaryPayTypes" array renamed to "items"
  - Service Branches
    - "serviceBranches" array renamed to "items"
  - Special Circumstances
    - "specialCircumstances" array renamed to "items"
  - States
    - "states" array renamed to "items"
  - Treatment Centers
    - "facilities" array renamed to "items"


- Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.
- Be tolerant with unknown fields in the payload, ignore deserialization of new fields but do not eliminate them from the payload if needed for subsequent PUT requests.
- Follow the redirect when the server returns HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).
- Responses are in JSON instead of HTML.
- Minor improvements to HTTPS Response Codes. (i.e. treatment centers invalid state was 200 and is now 400, new 429 rate limit errors, unauthorized 401, refer to <Link to="https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits_reference_data?version=current">API specification</Link> for complete information).
- For the treatment center endpoint, the optional “stateCode” query parameter must now be 2 capital letters, otherwise a 400 response is returned. Previously, a 200 with a blank array was returned.
- Optional pagination is supported (new fields were added to in the responses even if the optional pagination parameters are not used for certain end points).
- URL changes for the services. (Legacy production URLs are https://www.ebenefits.va.gov:444/wss-referencedata-services-web/rest/referencedata/v1/<endpointname> and new production URLs are: https://api.va.gov/services/benefits-reference-data/v1/<endpoint name>)
