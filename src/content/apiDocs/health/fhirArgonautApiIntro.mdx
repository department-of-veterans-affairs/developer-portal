## Argonaut Data Query

The Argonaut Project is a joint project of major US EHR vendors to advance industry adoption of modern, open interoperability standards. VA’s FHIR Argonaut Data Query API is based upon the FHIR DSTU-2 specification, particularly the [Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/index.html). As noted in the implementation guide, the resources and requirements supported by Argonaut are a subset of those profiles included in DSTU-2.

The profiles included in VA’s Argonaut Data Query API are compliant with the FHIR Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide and satisfy the following two following use cases:

 * Patient uses provider-approved web application to access health data
 * Patient uses provider-approved mobile app to access health data
