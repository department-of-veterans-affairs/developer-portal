VA’s Community Care Eligibility API utilizes VA’s Facility API, VA's Enrollment & Eligibility system and others to satisfy requirements found in the VA's MISSION Act of 2018. Please visit VA's Official MISSION Act of 2018 page for more information about the specific requirements.

The Community Care Eligibility API allows consumers to provide Veteran’s the ability to know if they meet the following MISSION Act requirements:

* If a Veteran needs a service (one of the 12 services returned from VA’s Facility API) it will show the nearest VA facility that meets your needs, calculating average drive times. Please see VA’s Facility endpoint for drive time calculation specifics
* If a Veteran needs a service and there are no VA Facilities in the Veteran's state or territory, it will display the Veteran’s community care eligibility
* Using the VA’s Enrollment and Eligibility system it will identify if a Veteran is eligible for the “Grandfather” Provision
* If the VA cannot furnish care within certain designated access standards, it will display a Veteran's community care eligibility (for the specified 12 services mentioned above)
