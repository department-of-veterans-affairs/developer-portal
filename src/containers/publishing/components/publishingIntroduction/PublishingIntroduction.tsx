    <p>
      <strong>VA Lighthouse APIs work with internal VA teams to publish the APIs they’ve created.</strong> Together,
      Lighthouse and VA are driving innovation to help Veterans control their data and access the benefits they’ve earned.
      If you are an internal VA team and want to publish your API to help further the goals of the Office of Information and
      Technology <a href="https://www.oit.va.gov/reports/year-in-review/2020/">digital transformation strategy</a>, you’re in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Publishing your API on Lighthouse results in a streamlined API experience for you and your consumers.
      Our vision is to create the most reliable and usable API program in government to enable innovation and fast integration.
      Simplify your API management and help us achieve our goals by publishing your API on the Lighthouse developer portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We publish only modern, <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">RESTful</a> APIs, but if your API follows another protocol and you’re interested in publishing
      your API on our platform, reach out to us. We may be able to help you convert your API so you can benefit from being
      part of the Lighthouse community.
    </p>
    <h2>Lighthouse is your solution</h2>
    <p>
      Publishing your API on Lighthouse lifts much of the administrative and maintenance burden from your team to ours.
      We act as your API partner and consultant and are invested in your team’s success. The benefits of working
      with us are far-reaching for both you and your consumers, including:

      </SectionWithIcon>
      <SectionWithIcon header="Effective documentation" imageFile={docsImage}>
        <p>
          We help your API documentation conform to our documentation standards, improving usability and ensuring human readability.
          We handle versioning in a clear and visible way, meaning no more multi-versioned Word documents or hard-to-access Sharepoint sites.

      <SectionWithIcon header="Self-service access" imageFile={checkImage}>
        <p>
          Partners can use tools such as sample requests to quickly allow their application to consume your API.
          Our sandbox environment is self-service, making it easy for partners to quickly (and automatically!) gain access
          and see responses and functionality in real-time.

      <SectionWithIcon header="Reduced overhead" imageFile={costImage}>
        <p>
          Publishing with Lighthouse shifts the burden of access control, authentication, consent, rate limiting, and more.

        </p>
      </SectionWithIcon>
