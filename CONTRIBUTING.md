## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, if you have access, it is best to search for existing threads in the [#team-okapi](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C01931CFMTQ) channel in the Lighthouse Slack workspace.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- If you have access to the Lighthouse Slack workspace, ask your question directly in the [#team-okapi](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C01931CFMTQ) channel.
- If you do not have access ot the Lighthouse Slack workspace, contact the support team through the [developer portal support form](https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us).
- Regardless of how you contact us:
  - Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
  - Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

## Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the documentation. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We have a support team able to receive and track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [support request](https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will address the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be added to the backlog to be prioritized and resolved by a member of the team in accordance to the priorities currently underway.

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for developer-portal, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the documentation carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature or to develop the feature yourself and contribute it to the project.

### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked internally and can be submitted through the [developer portal support form](https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us).

- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include links to screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most developer-portal users.
