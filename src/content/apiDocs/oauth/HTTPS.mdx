<SectionHeaderWrapper heading="HTTPS" id="https" />

Outside of local development environments, all redirect endpoints must use the `https` protocol for communication. The `https` protocol provides a secure encrypted connection between the user's client, your application, and the Lighthouse platform and authorization servers. This mitigates the risk of some types of man-in-the-middle attacks and prevents third-parties from intercepting user's authorization credentials.
