The VAâ€™s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Argonaut, DSTU2 and R4 Health API support industry standards and provide access to healthcare data via an EHR-agnostic RESTful web services abstraction layer. FHIR solutions are built from a set of modular components called "Resources". These resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and administrative problems.

The Health API allow users/applications to access a synthetic Veteran health database interacting with or understanding the inner workings of VA systems.

The database is populated with synthetic Veteran data provided by MITRE Corporation. The data contains sample Veteran health records (both living and deceased) that mimic real Veteran demographics. The associated clinical resources include data generated from disease models covering up to a dozen of the most common Veteran afflictions. It also contains mock data representative of Veteran eligibility status for determining if a Veteran is eligible for Urgent Care.
