We are working to give Veterans control of their information – their service history, Veteran status, discharge information, and more – and letting them control who sees it. And, we’re working with government agencies and industry partners to help Veterans put their information to work.

Note: The Address Validation service is for internal VA use only. If you would like to request access, please email [api@va.gov](mailto:api@va.gov?Subject=Request%20for%20Address%20Validation%20Access).
