This page walks you through the steps toward authorization and authentication for using OAuth APIs on the Lighthouse platform. We provide examples throughout this document that you can copy and use to get started. 

They are shown with generic cURL commands. Select your API from the drop-down near each cURL command to populate the examples with your API-specific URLs, parameters, and scopes.

- [Building OpenID Connect Applications](#building-openid)
- [Scopes](#scopes)
- [ID Token](#id-token)
- [Test Users](#test-users)

### It’s also good to know that: 
- The access credentials we supply are for the sandbox environment only and will not work in the production environment. 
- This page provides examples that show authorization server URLs in the sandbox environment, which will differ depending on the API. 
- When your application is ready, you may [apply for production access](/go-live).

<HeadingWrapper heading="Getting Started" id="getting-started"/>

The VA Lighthouse APIs platform uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) standard to allow Veterans to authorize third-party applications or Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to access data on their behalf. The kind of access granted, process for authorization, and third party being authorized depends on the API. 

The first step toward authorization is to [fill out our application](/apply) and make sure to select the right OAuth API for your needs. To complete the form, you will need: 
- Your organization name
- To know which OAuth APIs you want to access
- To know whether your app can securely hide a client secret
- Your OAuth redirect URI

After you submit the form, we send you a client ID and secret, depending on whether you can safely store a client secret. If you cannot safely store a client secret, we will send you a client ID and you will use the [Proof Key for Code Exchange](/explore/verification/docs/authorization#proof-key-for-code-exchange) (PKCE) flow ([RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) for authorization. 

### Support
If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to the VA API Platform team at api@va.gov. If you would like to report a bug or make a feature request, please open an issue through our [Support page.](/support)

<HeadingWrapper heading="Building OpenID Connect Applications" id="building-openid"/>

After being approved to use OpenID Connect, you'll receive a client id. 
- If you are building a **server-based application**, you’ll also receive a client secret and will use the [authorization code flow](link-to-Initiating-the-Auth-code-flow-on-this-page) to complete authentication. 
- If you are unable to **safely store a client secret** such as a native mobile app, you will [use PKCE](link-to-PKCE-auth-on-this-page) to complete authentication. 

### Initiating the Authorization Code Flow

**NOTE:** We provide a sample [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) application for demonstrating how to get up and running with our OAuth system. You can find the complete source code for it on our [GitHub.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/tree/master/samples/oauth_node)

Begin the OpenID Connect authorization by using the authorization endpoint, query parameters, and scopes listed below.

One method to achieve this for Web Server Clients is to store a cryptographically random value as an HttpOnly session cookie and use a cryptographic hash of the value as the nonce parameter.

When the session is invalid or there are scopes the user has not consented to, one of the following errors will be thrown: login_required or consent_required.</p> |

The Veteran will need to grant your application access permission. To do this, direct the Veteran to the URL above. The Veteran is taken through an authentication flow by VA.gov and asked to consent to your application accessing their data. The data that can be accessed is defined by your scopes. After the Veteran gives permission, your application will receive a response based on the response_type you requested

#### Authorization Code Grant

After a Veteran gives authorization for you to access their data, their browser will be redirected to your application with the response shown below, which returns the code and state parameters you must use to make a request to our authorization service. We require the state parameter for all authorization code grant flows. 

<!-- add copy button -->
<CodeWrapper>

```plaintext
GET <yourRedirectURL>?
  code=z92dapo5
  &state=af0ifjsldkj
Host: <yourRedirectHost>
```

</CodeWrapper>

Use the following format, in HTTP basic authentication, for your request using the returned code and state parameters.
- Use your client ID and client secret as the HTTP basic authentication username and password.
- Be sure to replace *< yourRedirectURL >* with the redirect URL that you provided during registration.

<!-- add copy button -->
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded *client id* + ':' + *client secret*}

grant_type=authorization_code&code=z92dapo5&state=af0ifjsldkj&redirect_uri=<yourRedirectURL>
```

</CodeWrapper>

The authorization server will respond with an [access token](#id-token). If you requested the offline_access scope, you will also receive a refresh_token. The response will look like this:

<!-- (Dynamic Portion Below - API selector) -->
<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "patient": "1558538470",
  "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

If an error occurs, you will instead receive a response like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error": "invalid_request"
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

Use the returned access_token to authorize requests to our platform by including it in the header of HTTP requests as Authorization: Bearer {access_token}. 

**NOTE:** the [access token](#id-token) will only work for the API and scopes for which you have previously initiated authorization. If you need additional scopes in the future, you will need to build a new authorization URL with the additional scopes and have the Veteran grant consent again. 

Use the refresh_token to obtain a new access_token after its expiry by sending the following request.

<!-- (Dynamic Portion Below - API selector) -->
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded *client id* + ':' + *client secret*}

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your refresh_token}&scope={space separated scopes}
```

</CodeWrapper>

The response will return a new access_token and refresh_token, if you requested the offline_access scope. 

#### Manage Account

The manage endpoint directs end users to a URL where they can view which applications currently have access to their data and can make adjustments to these access rights (grants).

<!-- (Dynamic Portion Below - API selector) -->
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
```

</CodeWrapper>

#### Revoking Tokens

Clients may revoke their own access_tokens and refresh_tokens using the revoke endpoint. Once revoked, the introspection endpoint will see the token as inactive.

<!-- (Dynamic Portion Below - API selector) -->
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded *client id* + ':' + *client secret*}

token={your access token}&token_type_hint=access_token
```

</CodeWrapper>

<!-- (Dynamic Portion Below - API selector) -->
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic {base64 encoded *client id* + ':' + *client secret*}

token={your refresh token}&token_type_hint=refresh_token
```

</CodeWrapper>

#### Revoking Grants

**NOTE:** This endpoint is not available in the production environment and excludes identity provider grants.

A user will be prompted only once to consent to each client's use of their data. Such a grant will remain in effect unless and until revoked. Grants for a specific user and client are revoked in the sandbox environment using the below endpoint. 

<!-- (Dynamic Portion Below - API selector) -->
<CodeWrapper>

```http
DELETE /oauth2/grants HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

{
	"client_id": {client_id},
	"email": {test account email}
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

The client ID is your application client ID (client_id) and the email is the user’s email, which must be passed into the body of the request. Bad requests will be returned with an error response and description of the error.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "error_description": "Invalid email address."
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) Authorization

**NOTE:** We provide a [sample CLI application](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/tree/master/samples/oauth_pkce_cli) for getting started using PKCE.
Begin the OpenID Connect authorization by using the authorization endpoint, query parameters, and scopes listed below.

| <span>state</span>                 | **Required** | Specifying a state param helps protect against some classes of Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, and applications must include it. The state param will be passed back from the authorization server to your redirect URL unchanged, and your application should verify that it has the expected value. This helps assure that the client receiving the authorization response is the same as the client that initiated the authorization process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| <span>scope</span>                 | Optional     | Will use your application's default scopes unless you specify a smaller subset of scopes separated by a space.

| <span>prompt</span>                | Optional     | Supported prompts: login, consent and none.<p>If login is specified, the user will be forced to provide credentials regardless of session state. If omitted, an existing active session with the identity provider may not require the user to provide credentials.</p><p>If consent is specified, the user will be asked to consent to their scopes being used regardless of prior consent.</p><p>If none is specified, an application will attempt an authorization request without user interaction. When the session is invalid or there are scopes the user has not consented to, one of the following errors will be thrown: login_required or consent_required.</p> |

The Veteran will need to grant your application access permission. To do this, direct the Veteran to the URL above. The Veteran is taken through an authentication flow by VA.gov and asked to consent to your application accessing their data. The data that can be accessed is defined by your scopes. After the Veteran gives permission, your application will receive an authorization code.

### Authorization Code Grant
After the Veteran consents to authorize your application,  their browser will redirect to your application with the response shown below, which returns the code and state parameters you must use to make a request to our authorization service and the code_verifier used to create the code_challenge in the previous step.

<CodeWrapper>

```plaintext
 code=z92dapo5
 &state=af0ifjsldkj
Host: <yourRedirectHost>

```

</CodeWrapper>

Use the following format, in HTTP basic authentication, for your request. 
- Use the code and state parameters that were returned in the previous step.
- Be sure to replace *< yourRedirectURL >* with the redirect URL that you provided during registration. 

<!-- (Dynamic Portion Below - API selector) -->
<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&code=z92dapo5&state=af0ifjsldkj&redirect_uri=<yourRedirectURL>&code_verifier=ccec_bace_d453_e31c_eb86_2ad1_9a1b_0a89_a584_c068_2c96
```

</CodeWrapper>

The authorization server will send a 200 response with an [access token](#id-token). If you requested the offline_access scope, you will also receive a refresh_token. The response body will look like this, where expires_in is the time in seconds before the token expires:

<CodeWrapper>

```
{
  "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

If an error occurs, you will instead receive a 400 response, like this:

<CodeWrapper>

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error": "invalid_request"
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

Use the returned access_token to authorize requests to our platform by including it in the header of HTTP requests as Authorization: Bearer {access_token}. 
**NOTE:** the [access token](#id-token) will only work for the API and scopes for which you have previously initiated authorization. 

Use the refresh_token to obtain a new access_token after its expiry by sending the following request.

<CodeWrapper>

```http
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sandbox-api.va.gov
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your refresh_token}&client_id={client_id}&scope={space separated scopes}
```

</CodeWrapper>

The response will return a new access_token and refresh_token, if you requested the offline_access scope.

Scopes define the API endpoint your application is allowed to access. We suggest requesting the fewest number of scopes for which you require a Veteran to provide consent. You can always request access to additional scopes if a Veteran or VSO needs the data while using your application.  

**Existing Scopes are:**

| Scope                    | Values and description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| profile                  | Granted by default, allows access to a user's first and last name and email.                                                             |
| offline_access           | This scope causes the authorization server to provide a refresh token when the [access token](#id-token) is requested.                   |
| openid                   | An id_token is available in the authorization code flow (response_type = code) token response when the 'openid' scope is used.          |

<HeadingWrapper heading="ID Token" id="id-token"/>

Access tokens and id_tokens are [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) or JWTs. A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. 

An id_token is available in the authorization code flow (response_type = code) token response when the openid scope is used.

Your application must validate JWT signatures. This allows your application to verify that the provided JWT originates from our authorization servers and prevents your application from accepting a JWT with claims that are attempting to impersonate one of your users.

### Header

The JWT's header has two fields, alg and kid. alg indicates the algorithm that was used the sign the JWT, and kid identifies the key that was used to sign the JWT. Signing keys and associated metadata are accessible from 
https://sandbox-api.va.gov/oauth2/.well-known/openid-configuration.

### Signature

The signature is a cryptographically generated signature of the JWT's header and payload used to confirm the JWT's authenticity. Your application must validate this signature using the alg and the kid from the JWT's header. You may want use one of the JWT libraries listed at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to help make this process easier.

### Payload

The payload is a JSON object containing identity and authentication-related claims. There are a couple claims in the JWT that are important for your application to consider:
- nonce - should match the nonce you initiated authorization with.
- exp - the expiration time of the JWT. The token cannot be accepted by the Lighthouse platform after this time, and your application should not use an expired token to identify a user.

<HeadingWrapper heading="Test Users" id="test-users"/>

Some APIs require test users and test data. Most of the test data provided from the Lighthouse platform comes from internal VA systems, is not real data, and are reset based upon new recordings of underlying services. We provide [test accounts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts.md) for you to use while developing your Lighthouse-based application, and you must be able to log in to access this data. These test accounts are API-specific, and contain data that is geared toward each API. 

### HTTPS

Outside of local development environments, all redirect endpoints must use the https protocol for communication. The https protocol provides a secure encrypted connection between the user's client, your application, and the Lighthouse platform and authorization servers. This mitigates the risk of some types of man-in-the-middle attacks and prevents third-parties from intercepting user's authorization credentials.
