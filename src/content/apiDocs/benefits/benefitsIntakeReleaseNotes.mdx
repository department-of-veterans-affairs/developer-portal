(v0) Version 0.0.1 of the Benefits Intake API was removed on March 29, 2021. Refer to [version 1.0.0](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits?version=current) of the API and related documentation.

### March 1, 2021
(v1) The Benefits-Intake API now has a new claim/benefit selection option to help ensure submissions reach the correct business line so they can be processed as quickly as possible: [#6037](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/6037)

The existing businessLine metadata field can be empty, or it can contain the code to indicate a document is related to one of these claim/benefit types:

CMP – Compensation requests such as those related to disability, unemployment, and pandemic claims
PMC – Pension requests including survivor’s pension
INS – Insurance such as life insurance, disability insurance, and other health insurance
EDU – Education benefits, programs, and affiliations
VRE – Veteran Readiness & Employment such as employment questionnaires, employment discrimination, employment verification
BVA – Board of Veteran Appeals
FID – Fiduciary/financial appointee, including family member benefits
OTH – Other (which will be routed to CMP)

This change is currently optional, but may become a required field in a future iteration of the API.
