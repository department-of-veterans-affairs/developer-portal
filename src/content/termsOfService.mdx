# VA API Terms of Service 
Thank you for using U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) APIs. By accessing or using our APIs, you are agreeing to the terms below. 

Please review these terms carefully. Once accepted, these terms become a binding legal commitment between you and the VA. If you do not agree to be bound by these terms, you should not use VA’s APIs. 

## Scope
The service ("API") through which you interact with VA data is subject to these terms. Use of the API constitutes acceptance to these Terms.

## Data Rights and Usage
### Accounts/Registration
If you are using the API on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to you and that entity).

In order to access the API, you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the API, or as part of your continued use of the API. Any registration information you give to VA must be accurate and up to date and you must inform us promptly of any updates so that we can keep you informed of any changes to the API or the Terms which may impact your usage of the API.

Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, tokens, and client IDs) are intended to be used only by you and identify any software which you are using with the APIs. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.

You will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If VA assigns you developer credentials (e.g., client IDs), you must use them with the applicable APIs.

### Attribution
While not required, when using content, data, documentation, code, and related materials associated with the API in your own work, we ask that proper credit be given. 

### Right to Limit
Your use of the API may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by VA. These limitations are designed to manage the load on the system, promote equitable access, and prevent abuse, and these limitations may be adjusted without notice, as deemed necessary by VA. If VA reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, your ability to use the API may be temporarily or permanently blocked. VA may monitor your use of the API to improve the service or to ensure compliance with this Agreement.

## Changes and Service Termination
### Changes to these Terms
We may revise these Terms from time to time. If we do, those revised Terms will supersede prior versions. Unless we say otherwise, revisions will be effective upon the effective date indicated at the top of these Terms. Your continued access or use of our Services constitutes your acceptance of any revisions. If you don’t agree to the revisions, you should stop using VA APIs and we are not obligated to provide you with the Services.

### Changes to Services 
The features and functions of our Services, including our APIs, and VA’s service level agreement (SLA), may change over time. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to our Services are compatible with our then-current Services. Although we try to avoid making changes to our Services that are not backwards compatible, if any such changes become necessary, we will use reasonable efforts to let you know at least sixty (60) days prior to implementing those changes.

### Service Termination

If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of the API. VA reserves the right (though not the obligation) to: (1) refuse to provide the API to you, if it is VA’s opinion that use violates any VA policy; or (2) terminate or deny you access to and use of all or part of the API at any time for any other reason which in its sole discretion it deems necessary to in order to prevent abuse. You may petition VA to regain access to the API. If VA determines in its sole discretion that the circumstances which led to the refusal to provide the API or terminate access to the API are no longer in existence, then VA may restore your access. All provisions of this Agreement shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

## Liability

### Disclaimer of Warranties
The API platform is provided "as is" and on an "as-available" basis. While we will do our best to ensure the service is available and functional at all times, VA hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. VA makes no warranty that data will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.

### Limitations on Liability

In no event will VA be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (1) any special, incidental, or consequential damages; (2) the cost of procurement of substitute products or services; or (3) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data.

### Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless VA, its contractors, employees, agents, and the like, from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorney’s fees, arising out of your use of the API, including but not limited to violation of this Agreement.

### Disputes
Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the API shall be governed by federal law. Some APIs may have API specific Terms. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a specific API, the additional terms will control for that conflict.

### No Waiver Rights
VA’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute waiver of such right or provision.

## Privacy
You may use a VA API to develop a service to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view and otherwise ‘get’ information from VA, which requires special safeguarding. You agree to strictly abide by all applicable federal and state laws regarding the protection and disclosure of information obtained through a VA API.

You further acknowledge that when records regarding an individual are obtained through a VA API, you may not expose that content to other individuals or third parties without specific, explicit consent from the individual or his or her authorized representative, or as permitted by applicable law. The terms “individual” and “record” have the meanings given in the Privacy Act at 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a).
