VA offers an urgent care benefit that provides Veterans with greater choice and access to timely, high-quality care. Urgent care providers treat injuries and illnesses that require immediate attention but are not life-threatening. The Urgent Care Eligibility API allows a Veteran to determine if they are eligible to receive urgent care from a community provider.

For a Veteran to be eligible to receive urgent care, a Veteran must meet ALL the following criteria:

 * Be enrolled in the VA health care system; and
 * Have received care through VA from either a VA Medical Center or community provider within the past 24 months

The Urgent Care Eligibility API uses VA’s Enrollment and Eligibility system to determine a Veteran's eligibility and displays the information in a FHIR format, using HL7's FHIR R4 CoverageEligibilityResponse resource. Please see the FHIR [CoverageEligibilityResponse](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/coverageeligibilityresponse.html) page for more information on this resource.
