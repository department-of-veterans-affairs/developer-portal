### UX APPROVED/PROPOSED FIRST RELEASE NOTE VERBIAGE:

We added a new API to the developer portal. This API was previously the EVSS Data Reference Service. It allows consumers to look up the following data for use with benefits claims:

* Contention types
* Countries
* Disabilities
* Intake sites
* Military pay types
* Service branches
* Special circumstances
* States
* VA medical treatment facilities

This API will return only the data that can be used for benefits claims. For example, this API may return only a subset of states or countries that apply to benefits claims.

There are some important differences between this API and the service it replaces:

* The new service requires an API key
* There are some stylistic differences such as changes to data types and camelCase
* Responses are in JSON instead of HTML
* For the treatment center endpoint, a 2-character state is required and any other input will now result in a 400 response rather than a 200 response or blank array

Learn more about this API by reviewing the Benefits Data Lookup API documentation. [LINK TO THE LIVE DOCUMENTATION].
