## The Loan Guaranty Public REST API provides endpoints for the VA's Loan Guaranty (LGY) services.

The Department of Veterans Affairs helps Servicemembers, Veterans, and eligible surviving spouses become homeowners. As part of our mission to serve Veterans, we provide a home loan guaranty benefit and other housing-related programs to help Veterans buy, build, repair, retain, or adapt a home for their own personal occupancy. <Link to="/release-notes/loanGuaranty">Review the latest release notes</Link>.
