  This test is used in CI as part of end to end testing for the developer-portal.
  It is also periodicaly ran against the live site by our monitoring system to
  ensure we are properly rendering the site at a high level. There is probably a
  better way to ensure the site is rendering correctly, so we may add a monitoring
  specific test in the future.
