        No - this is a support page for software developers utilizing the Veterans Affairs (VA)
        Application Programming Interface (API). If you are a veteran seeking assistance, please visit
        the <a href="http://www.va.gov">US Department of Veterans Affairs website</a> to access and
        manage your VA benefits and health care. There are also helpful reference links and Q&amp;A at
        the VA Inquiry Routing &amp; Information System <a href="https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/app/answers/list">(IRIS)</a>.

        Click to <Link to="/apply">Get Started</Link> by applying for
        an API key. Note that you will need to provide your <Link to="/oauth">OAuth</Link> Redirect
        URL if you are applying for a key to the Health, Claims, or Veteran Verification APIs.
        You are also required to agree to the <Link to="/terms-of-service">VA API Terms of Service</Link> in order to obtain a key.

    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes! You will receive your API key immediately after sign up. That is all you
        need to proceed - all relevant information should be contained in the <Link to="/explore">API documentation</Link>.
      </p>

    answer: 'Yes, we have implemented basic rate limiting of 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this quota, your request will return a 429 status code. You may petition for increased rate limits by emailing api@va.gov and requests will be decided on a case-by-case basis.',
