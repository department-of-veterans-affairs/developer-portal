## Deprecation Notice

Consumers currently using the `https://api.va.gov/services/argonaut/v0` (and `https://dev-api.va.gov/services/argonaut/v0`) endpoint, please migrate your applications to use the new Veteran Health API (FHIR) endpoints: `https://api.va.gov/services/fhir/v0/argonaut/data-query/` and `https://dev-api.va.gov/services/fhir/v0/argonaut/data-query/`.

Both the legacy API endpoints and this legacy documentation page will no longer be accessible beginning Oct 1, 2019.
