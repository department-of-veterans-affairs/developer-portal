VA’s Community Care Eligibility API utilizes VA’s Facility API, VA's Enrollment & Eligibility system and others to satisfy requirements found in the VA MISSION Act of 2018. Please visit the official [VA MISSION Act of 2018](https://missionact.va.gov/) page for more information about the specific requirements.

The Community Care Eligibility API allows consumers to provide Veterans the ability to know if they meet the following MISSION Act requirements:


* If a Veteran needs a service (one of the services returned from VA’s Facility API) it will show the nearest VA facility that meets your needs, calculating average drive times. Please see VA’s [Facility endpoint](/explore/facilities/docs/facilities) for drive time calculation specifics
* If a Veteran needs a service and there are no VA Facilities in the Veteran's state or territory, it will display the Veteran’s community care eligibility
* Using the VA’s Enrollment and Eligibility system it will identify if a Veteran is eligible for the “Grandfather” Provision
* If the VA cannot furnish care within certain designated access standards, it will display a Veteran's community care eligibility (for the specified 12 services mentioned above)
