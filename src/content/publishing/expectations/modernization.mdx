### What we provide

- Clarity regarding our API requirements
- Guidance for how to build modern APIs that meet our requirements

### What we need from you

- [APIs should be RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/soap-vs-rest-apis/). They should not use antiquated request and response formats. Ideal APIs leverage the REST architecture (not SOAP), use simple formats like JSON, and do not demand special tooling.
- [APIs should be stateless](https://restfulapi.net/statelessness/#:~:text=Being%20stateless%20makes%20REST%20APIs,easy%20to%20cache%20as%20well.&text=The%20server%20never%20loses%20track,necessary%20information%20with%20each%20request.). Each API call should include the necessary details required to process it. Session management should not be required.
- [APIs should be versioned](https://restfulapi.net/versioning/). Backward-incompatible changes should be published as a separate version. Changes between versions should be documented.
- [APIs should be cache-compatible](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-caching.html). Lighthouse will not necessarily cache API responses, but client applications must be able to rely on appropriate cache behavior.
- [APIs must be compatible with a layered architecture](https://apiacademy.co/2015/04/api-design-202-architectural-layers/) since they will be behind the API Gateway.
