You can now see if Health facilities offer Podiatry or Nutrition services.
* Added `Podiatry` and `Nutrition` to the array of available services for a facility, where available. At this time, we do not have satisfaction scores and are not exposing wait times for podiatry or nutrition services.

You can now see Health facilities' operating status and any important textual notes about that facility.
- Added `operating_status` and `additional_info` flags to the API response for Health facilities (other facility types will return null for these fields). Options for operating_status are `normal, notice, limited, closed`; options for `additional_info` is a text string showing details of facility notices for visitors, such as messages about parking lot closures or floor visitation information.
- `active_status` is deprecated and replaced with `operating_status`. It will be removed in version 1.

The Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) identifier for each health facility is now available.
- `visn` has been added to all `/facilities` endpoints. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3609)
- For non-health facilities, this will return as `null`.

## November 8, 2019
The `/nearby` endpoint received major changes.
- Previously, the server retrieved an isochrone (a line connecting points of the same time) for a provided location and looked for facilities that fell within that polygon. Now the opposite is true: facilities have isochrones that are compared against the provided location. Users should see increased performance from this endpoint as a result.
- Data about drive times now comes directly from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Responses may vary slightly from the previous implementation because of this switch.
- The response schema has also changed. Instead of returning facility data from `/nearby`, the endpoint now provides `min_time` and `max_time` attributes for the matching polygons and links to endpoints that can be queried to retrieve full information about the associated facility. This schema change allows us to keep `/nearby` within v0 of the Facilities API instead of incrementing to v1. See the schema changes by [visiting the documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/facilities/docs/facilities).

When including latitude and longitude parameters in a request to  `/facilities` the results are now sorted in ascending order by distance.
