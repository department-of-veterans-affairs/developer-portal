### August 24, 2021
Added the `code` data to the R4 `AllergyIntolerance` resource to be compliant with [US Core Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-allergyintolerance.html).

Updated the `Condition` resource to include both [SNOMED CT](http://snomed.info/sct) and [ICD-10-CM] codings when both are available.

### May 4, 2021
Added an `identifier` to the `Organization` resource to represent the VA Facility to be consistent with the Facility ID used by the Facilities API. For example a VAMC has an identifier of the form `vha_[stationNumber]` like `vha_673`.

Added an `identifier` to the `Location` resource to represent the VA clinic. This `identifier` has the form `vha_[stationNumber]_[clinic identifier]`.

### February 24, 2021
Added the FHIR R4 resource `Appointment`, which includes the ability to search appointments by `Patient` and `Location` references and searching by `_lastUpdated` date.

---
### December 15, 2020
The following three R4 resources have been made available: `Device`, `Practitioner`, and `PractitionerRole`. Not all US Core searches are yet supported for `Practitioner` and `PractitionerRole`.

The hold times for `Immunization` and COVID 19 Lab Results have been eliminated.

### August 31, 2020
In adherence to changes per the [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-07419/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification#h-13), the Veteran Health API profile, in line with the US Core Implementation Guide has added FHIR R4 resources to the R4 tab.

### August 7, 2020

We have updated the mock health records for test users in the Sandbox environment for the Veterans Health API `Condition` resource to list conditions from either SNOMED-CT or ICD-10 code sets.  Previously only SNOMED-CT codes were available.

### July 31, 2020
We are decreasing the data hold time for the Veterans Health API from 72 hours to 36 hours, effective July 31, 2020, based on an updated VHA policy.  When a physician enters or changes patient data, there is a holding period before the data is released and visible through other applications such as health apps. The holding period gives physicians time to contact their patients and discuss health data, such as sensitive diagnoses, before the patient sees this data elsewhere. This change applies only to real data entered into the production environment.

### July 13, 2020
The CoverageEligibilityResponse resource for Urgent Care is deprecated and scheduled for deactivation in the 3rd quarter of 2020.
We are working on new FHIR R4 resources and will add those in the 3rd quarter of 2020.
