VA offers an urgent care benefit that provides Veterans with greater choice and access to timely, high-quality care. Urgent care providers treat injuries and illnesses that require immediate attention but are not life-threatening. The Urgent Care Eligibility API allows a Veteran to determine if they are eligible to receive urgent care from a community provider.

For a Veteran to be eligible to receive urgent care, a Veteran must:

* Be enrolled in the VA health care system AND 
* Have received care through VA from either a VA medical center or community provider within the past 24 months

The Urgent Care Eligibility API utilizes VA Enrollment and Eligibility service to determine a Veteran's eligibility and displays the information in a FHIR format, using HL7's FHIR R4 `CoverageEligibilityResponse` resource.
